# Kratika Jain – Product Analytics & Data Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio showcasing real-world projects across digital marketing, predictive modeling, NLP, and user research. With 10 years of experience across finance, healthcare, and retail, I bring a product-thinking mindset to data-driven strategy, experimentation, and cross-functional collaboration.

## 🔍 Featured Projects

### 1. Phantom Inventory Detection and Out-of-Stock Forecasting
Developed ML models (Random Forest, LSTM, TimeGAN) to detect phantom inventory and forecast out-of-stock events for 14,000+ SKUs. Achieved 94% accuracy, helping improve supply chain visibility.

### 2. Digital Google Ad Campaign – Panera Bread
Designed and executed a 2x2 A/B test using Google Ads to evaluate brand color and food imagery impact on CTR. Applied behavioral theories and derived campaign strategy based on real-time metrics.

### 3. Text Generation with LSTM Using Nietzsche’s Writings
Built a character-level LSTM model to generate stylistically consistent text, demonstrating the generative capabilities of RNNs for creative applications.

### 4. Airbnb Revenue Drivers Analysis – Washington Market
Used XGBoost and LightGBM to model superhost prediction and occupancy rates. Delivered actionable insights on pricing, guest satisfaction, and platform optimization.

### 5. Handwritten Digit Classification with Deep Neural Networks
Implemented a multi-layer perceptron model using TensorFlow on the MNIST dataset, achieving strong classification accuracy with clear visualizations.

## 💡 About Me
I’m a recent graduate in Business Analytics from Purdue University. I'm looking for Data Scientist role where I can apply my expertise in machine learning and model building.
